# UI2HTML

Implementing UI2HTML: Leveraging Chain of Thought in LLM Agents for Converting UI Designs into HTML Code

## Project Overview

UI2HTML is an innovative tool for automatically converting UI designs (video or images) into HTML code. This project leverages the Chain of Thought (CoT) capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) to achieve high-quality UI to HTML conversion.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Combines edge detection and visual analysis for UI understanding
- **Multiple CoT Strategies**: Implements standard CoT, tree thinking, and graph thinking strategies
- **Automated Evaluation**: Includes a complete evaluation framework supporting multi-dimensional comparison
- **Visual Output**: Generates multiple versions of HTML implementation for comparison and selection

├── evaluate.py # Evaluation tools
├── llm_util.py # LLM utility class
├── preprocess.py # Image preprocessing tools

```

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```
python run_main.py --video path/to/video.mp4 --output output_dir
```

### Parameters

- `--video, -v`: Input video file path
- `--output, -o`: Output directory path
- `--sample-rate, -s`: Video sampling rate (seconds)
- `--mode, -m`: Running mode (full/ablation/both)

### Running Modes

1. **Full Analysis (full)**
   - Uses edge detection and visual analysis
   - Generates multiple HTML versions
   - Outputs detailed analysis results

2. **Ablation Study (ablation)**
   - Uses visual analysis only
   - Generates baseline HTML version
   - For comparative research

3. **Complete Evaluation (both)**
   - Runs both modes and compares results
   - Generates detailed evaluation report

## Output Description

### Directory Structure
```

├── html_versions/ # HTML generated by different strategies
│ ├── visualization_standard_cot.html
│ ├── visualization_tree_of_thought.html
│ └── visualization_graph_of_thought.html

```

### Evaluation Metrics

- Text similarity
- HTML tag similarity
- Tree structure distance
- Vector similarity

## Implementation Details

### Chain of Thought Strategies

1. **Standard Chain of Thought**
   - Linear thinking process
   - Based on direct analysis results

2. **Tree of Thought**
   - Tree-based decision process
   - Considers multiple possible implementations

3. **Graph of Thought**
   - Graph-based thinking mode
   - Focuses on relationships between components

### Evaluation Framework

- Multi-dimensional comparison mechanism
- Automated scoring system
- Detailed comparison report generation
